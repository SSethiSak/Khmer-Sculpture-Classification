Though Buddhism eventually became the dominant religion of Cambodia, Brahma's influence is imprinted in the artistic, architectural, and philosophical landscapes of the Khmer Empire. Numerous carvings and statues portray Brahma's image, offering clues about how he was visually represented and interpreted within the Cambodian context. Additionally, the concept of creation and Brahma's symbolic association with knowledge likely influenced the Khmer cosmological worldview and perspectives on the origins of the world. While his worship diminished over time, Brahma's historical significance in Cambodia offers a fascinating window into the intersection of religious and cultural exchange in Southeast Asia.
