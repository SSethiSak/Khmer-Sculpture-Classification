Beyond his tangible contributions, Jayavarman VII's influence permeates deeper into Cambodian history and national identity. His successful expulsion of foreign invaders solidified his reputation as a liberator and protector of Khmer sovereignty.  The artistic depictions from his reign, often featuring Jayavarman VII with a serene Buddha-like expression, reflect his dedication to Buddhism and highlight the fusion of religious and political power. Though later Cambodian chronicles did not preserve his memory, modern archaeological discoveries have rekindled his significance. Today, Jayavarman VII is celebrated as a national hero, symbolizing a golden age of Cambodian power and cultural vibrancy.
