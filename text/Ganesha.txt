While the Hindu presence in Southeast Asia eventually waned, Ganesha's impact on Cambodian culture remains evident. His image can be found in the remarkable artistic legacy of the Khmer Empire, adorning intricate temple carvings and freestanding statues.  These depictions often differ subtly from Indian representations, suggesting a degree of adaptation within the Cambodian context. Beyond visual art, his association with wisdom and beginnings likely shaped Khmer perspectives on education and new endeavors. Although predominantly a Buddhist nation today, Cambodia's rich history showcases Ganesha's enduring influence in shaping its cultural and artistic heritage.
