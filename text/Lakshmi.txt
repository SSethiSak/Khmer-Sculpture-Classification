Lakshmi is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune, abundance, auspiciousness, and beauty.  She is typically depicted as a radiant, four-armed woman adorned with jewels and holding lotus flowers, symbolizing her blessings.  Elephants often accompany her image, representing royalty and abundance.

Lakshmi's Presence in Khmer Culture

Goddess of Prosperity: Lakshmi's importance lies in her association with wealth and material prosperity – essential aspects Khmer kings sought for their kingdom.

Symbol of Queenly Power:  Lakshmi's grace and regal iconography resonated with depictions of powerful queens, highlighting their importance in maintaining social harmony and prosperity within the kingdom.

Architectural Adornment:  Lakshmi's image adorns many Khmer temples, often flanking doorways or gracing temple lintels.  The depictions can include her standing majestically with elephants showering her with water.  These representations highlight her significance in bringing wealth and abundance to the sacred spaces.

Enduring Significance  While Vishnu and Shiva were primarily worshipped in state temples, Lakshmi remained an important goddess for the general population.  Her appeal for fortune and good luck has endured to present times.

Key Points to Consider
